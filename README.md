# Single-Life-Of-A-Singly-Linked-List : Recursion, Inversion, and Rotation

Update a Singly-Linked list class to support inversion and rotation functionality. In order to successfully complete this project, you must understand 
the concept of a Linked List ADT.

## Implementation

Work incrementally! Work through the tasks sequentially (implement and test). Only move on to a task when you are positive that the previous one has 
been completed correctly. Remember that the names of function prototypes and member variables must exactly match those declared in the respective header 
file when implementing a class.

“A singly-linked list can be inverted” was once a song of dreams, a tale from a time before the invention of the doubly-linked list. Then, the budding 
programmer could iterate from head to tail, but they could not iterate from tail to head - that is, until one thought of a way to take a singly-linked 
list and invert it in order to make all of the links point in the opposite direction. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to implement this 
inversion within the provided ```LinkedList``` files. Your implementation must be in O(n) time using O(1) extra space. This can be acheived by splitting your 
list into two parts, the first and the rest. Here is an example:
